# Tic-Tac-Toe-game

## Technology used was HTML, CSS and Javascript
- I used HTML to give the base structure of the project. Once I had the structure I began styling with CSS. 
- I used JS to define the logic of the game and hide/display certain HTML elements for the game to make sense

## Approach
- I orginally tried to loop through the possible winning combinations in JS but found I was creating more and more issues so I decided to hard code all the possible winning combos for player X and O.
